## mirroredArray.py:

Given an array as input, find out if an array has an index that satisfies the following requirement:

sum of numbers left of index equals sum of numbers right of index.

If such an index exists, print index number(index starts as 1, not 0). Otherwise print -1.

### For example:

Array[0,5,3,5]-->Returns 3, as 0+5=5

Array[0,5]-->Returns 2, as 0=0

Array[1,2,4]-->Returns -1

Array[3]-->Returns -1
